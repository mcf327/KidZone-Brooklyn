# KidZone Brooklyn

KidZone Brooklyn is an idea born from my own struggle as a parent to find good, kid-friendly activities and destinations nearby. Living in a dense city, it can be tough to sift through the multitude of parks, businesses, neighborhoods, etc to find the places that you can actually enjoy with your family. How helpful would it be to have a list of user-recommended destinations, by parents and for parents? I may refer back to this project myself the next time I need a suggestion.
